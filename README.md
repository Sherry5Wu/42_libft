# libft

This project is the very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.
Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

Note: remember using command 'paco --strict' to test your functions too.
